## SMART CONTRACT VULNERABILITIES DETECTION USING CHATGPT

### INFO

In this repository we will use ChatGPT for vulenerability detection in smart contracts(writed in solidity). 
The research is based on the following [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05520). 

In the Research we did the following steps:
* Try to reproduce the results of the research we based on using the data we found.
* Use different prmopts and check the impact of the predictions comparing to the other experiments.
* Use different models and check their prediction


### CODE 

The code is in Python and we used Jupyet notebooks. We have 2 main notebooks:
* `data_processing.py` - In this notebook we process the smart contracts and using all the different sources we have.
* `model_evaluation.py` - In this notebook we compare the different results of the experiments and different metrics to determine the precision.
