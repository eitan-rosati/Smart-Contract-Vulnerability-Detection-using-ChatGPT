In the experiment we used 2 datasets: the ethereum dataset and the smartbug-curated.
When we described to ChatGPT 4 different vulnerabilities:

Reentrancy - Reentrant function calls make a contract to behave in an unexpected way. 
Arithmetic - Integer over/underflows.
Unchecked Return Values - call(), callcode(), delegatecall() or send() fails and it is not checked.
Time Manipulation - The timestamp of the block is manipulated by the miner.
